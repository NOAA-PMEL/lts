#### OceanSITES Long term Timeseries Dashboard 
This is the code for the 
[OceanSITES long term timeseries data dashboard](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/oceansites/lts/). This is a Dash application
which uses the [Dash Bootstrap Components](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/) for widgets and 
layout.

Currently, the dashboard has temperature and salinity observations from:
 - [KEO (both)](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/keo_hourly.html)
 - [PAPA TEMP](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/papa_hourly_temp.html)
 - [PAPA PSAL](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/papa_hourly_psal.html)
 - [RAMA TEMP](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/rama_hourly_temp.html)
 - [RAMA PSAL](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/rama_hourly_psal.html)  
 - [PIRATA TEMP](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/pirata_hourly_temp.html)
 - [PIRATA PSLA](https://data.pmel.noaa.gov/generic/erddap/tabledap/pirata_hourly_psal.html)


But, you should really use the dashboard link above which lets you find the data of interest, see plots of 
it and then download that data quickly and easily. :wink:
